## ðŸ”— Next.js Routing System

- Each folder in the `app` directory becomes a route 


<div align="center">
<img src="./1.png" alt="image" width="200" >
</div>

- The folder name becomes the routes' path.
<div align="center">
<img src="./2.png" alt="image" width="200" >
</div>


- For example if we want to create a route for the `about` page, we create a folder called `about` inside the `app` directory.
you can access the `about` page by going to `localhost:3000/about`
