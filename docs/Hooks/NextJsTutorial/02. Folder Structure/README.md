# NextJs Tutorial for Beginners

## 📁 Folder Structure

- After Installing Next.js, you will see the following folder structure:
  `next 13.4`
```

```


-  `.next`: This folder contains the generated output of the Next.js application. It includes static files, server-side rendered pages, and other build artifacts. You should not modify this folder manually as it is overwritten by Next.js during development and production builds.


-  `node_modules`: This folder contains the dependencies of the project that are installed by `npm` or `yarn`. You should not modify this folder manually as it is managed by the package manager.


-  `public`: This folder contains static assets that can be accessed by the browser directly. You can place images, icons, fonts, or any other files that are not part of the Next.js pages or components in this folder. The files in this folder are served from the root path of the application, for example `/public/next.svg` can be accessed as `/next.svg`.


-  `app`: This folder contains the source code of the Next.js application. You can create pages, components, hooks, or any other files that are part of the application logic in this folder. The files in this folder are processed by Next.js and transformed into JavaScript bundles that are sent to the browser or executed on the server.
    - `favicon.ico`: This file is the icon that appears in the browser tab when visiting the application. You can replace this file with your own icon if you want to customize it.
    - `globals.css`: This file contains global CSS styles that are applied to the entire application. You can use this file to define custom variables, fonts, resets, or any other styles that are not specific to a single page or component.
    - `layout.tsx`: The `layout.tsx` file is one of the most important files in our Next.js app. It is the main entry point of our application and it defines the common layout for all the pages. Any components we include in this file will be shared throughout our entire application. For example, we can use this file to render a navbar and a footer that will appear on every page. We can also use this file to customize the appearance and behavior of our HTML document. We can set the language attribute, modify the metadata, add script tags, links, fonts, or any other elements that we want to have in the head section of our document. We can also use this file to wrap our components with any providers or contexts that we need, such as Redux Toolkit or React Query. The `layout.tsx` file takes all the children components as props and renders them inside the layout. This way, we can create different pages with different content, but still use the same layout for all of them. In summary, the `layout.tsx` file is where we put anything that should stay consistent across all routes in our Next.js app.
    - `page.tsx`: The `page.tsx` file is another important file in our Next.js app. It defines the content and logic of the home page of our application. That is, it's what we see when we go to `localhost:3000/` or the root path of our app. In this file, we can use React components, hooks, or any other features to create our UI and functionality for the home page.You can also use this component to customize the head tags, title, meta tags, or other SEO attributes of each page using the `Head` component from Next.js. For example, we can fetch data, render a list of items, handle user input, or perform any other tasks that are specific to the home page. The `page.tsx` file is just a typical React component that returns some JSX elements. In this case, it's just a simple boilerplate code that shows a welcome message and some links.


-  `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or folders to ignore when committing changes to the repository. You can use this file to exclude files that are not part of the source code, such as `.next`, `node_modules`, `.env`, or any other files that contain sensitive or temporary information.


-  `next-env.d.ts`: This file tells TypeScript which types to use for Next.js specific features, such as dynamic imports, image optimization, or custom server. You should not modify this file manually as it is generated by Next.js during development and production builds.


-  `next.config.js`: This file allows you to configure various aspects of Next.js behavior, such as custom webpack configuration, runtime environment variables, redirects, rewrites, internationalization, or plugins. You can use this file to customize how Next.js builds and runs your application according to your needs.


-  `package-lock.json`: This file locks the exact versions of the dependencies that are installed by `npm`. You should not modify this file manually as it is managed by `npm`. You should commit this file to your repository to ensure consistent installations across different environments.


-  `package.json`: This file contains information about the project, such as name, version, description, scripts, dependencies, devDependencies, or any other metadata. You can use this file to define how to start, build, test, or deploy your application using `npm` scripts. You can also use this file to specify which dependencies are required for your application to run properly.


-  `postcss.config.js`: This file allows you to configure PostCSS plugins that are used by Next.js to process CSS files. You can use this file to enable features such as Tailwind CSS, Autoprefixer, PurgeCSS, or any other PostCSS plugins that you want to use in your project.


-  `README.md`: This file contains documentation about the project, such as how to install, run, test, or deploy it. You can use this file to explain what your project does, how it works, what technologies it uses, or any other information that you want to share with others who might use or contribute to your project.


- `tailwind.config.js`: This file allows you to configure Tailwind CSS options that are used by Next.js
